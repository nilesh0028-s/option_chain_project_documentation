        <p>
            Max pain (also called “maximum pain price”) is the strike price where option buyers, in total, would lose
            the most money at expiry and option sellers would lose the least amount of money .
        </p>
        <p>
            At this price, the maximum number of call and put options expire worthless or with very little value, so
            most buyers lose their premiums while sellers keep most of what they collected.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Many traders believe that, as expiry comes closer, the underlying price sometimes moves toward this
                max‑pain strike, because big option sellers try to hedge or manage their risk around that level. so max
                pain is not a guarantee or a magic target, just one way to see how positions are stacked in the option
                chain.</strong>

        <h3 class="pb-2">How to claculate MaxPain?</h3>
        <p>
            To calculate max pain, you need to look at the open interest (OI) for all the call and put options at each
            strike price. Open interest is the total number of outstanding option contracts that have not been exercised
            or closed.</p>

        <h2>How to Read This Chart</h2>

        <p>
            This chart helps us understand how interest is distributed across different price levels.
            Each part of the chart represents a specific meaning.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>X-axis (Horizontal Axis):</strong><br>
                Shows the strike prices such as <strong>100, 110, and 120</strong>.
                These are the price levels where traders have placed their expectations.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Y-axis (Vertical Axis):</strong><br>
                Represents <strong>Open Interest</strong>, which means how many active positions
                exist at each strike price.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            By comparing the height of the bars at each strike price, we can understand
            where interest is balanced and where it is heavily concentrated.

        <h3 class="pb-2">Why Is It Called “Pain”?</h3>
        <p>
            It is called <strong>Max Pain</strong> because it shows the price level where
            option buyers feel the most pain by losing most of the premiums they paid.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the same level, sellers feel the least pain because
            they are able to keep most of the money they collected.
        </p>

        <h3 class="pb-2">How Traders Actually Use Max Pain</h3>
        <p>
            Some traders use Max Pain only as a <strong>reference level</strong>,
            especially near expiry, to check whether the price is moving
            toward or away from it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Max Pain is often combined with other market information such as:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Support and resistance levels</li>
            <li>Open interest build-up</li>
            <li>Market trend</li>
            <li>Trading volume</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Max Pain is one tool for expiry analysis, not a stand-alone signal to buy or sell.</strong>
                
            
        </p>

        <h3 class="pb-2">Limitations of Max Pain</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Max Pain can change when open interest changes, so it is not a fixed level.
            </li>
            <li>
                Big news events, price gaps, or strong trends can move the market far away
                from the Max Pain level.
            </li>
            <li>
                Max Pain only shows where losses would be highest if the price closes there;
                it does not guarantee that the price will move to that level.
            </li>
        </ul>
