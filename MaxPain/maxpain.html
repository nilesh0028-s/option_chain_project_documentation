        <h2 class="pb-2 border-bottom">What is MaxPain ?</h2>
        <p>
            Max pain (also called “maximum pain price”) is the strike price where option buyers, in total, would lose
            the most money at expiry and option sellers would lose the least amount of money .
        </p>
        <p>
            At this price, the maximum number of call and put options expire worthless or with very little value, so
            most buyers lose their premiums while sellers keep most of what they collected.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Many traders believe that, as expiry comes closer, the underlying price sometimes moves toward this
                max‑pain strike, because big option sellers try to hedge or manage their risk around that level. so max
                pain is not a guarantee or a magic target, just one way to see how positions are stacked in the option
                chain.</strong>

            <p class="pb-2">
                This indicates the most recent time when the option chain data was refreshed. It helps users know how
                current the information is.

            <h4 class="pb-2"><strong>2.</strong>Live Status</h4>
            <p class="pb-2">
                The Live Status indicator confirms that the option chain data is updating in real time.
                 The timer shown next to it (for example, 0 min 12s) indicates how many seconds ago the data was last refreshed.

        <h3 class="pb-2"> <strong>1. Max Pain</strong></h3>
        <p class="pb-2">Max Pain is the strike price at which option sellers (writers) face the least total loss at expiry.In simple words: It is the price where most option buyers lose money And most option sellers gain money</p>
        <h3 class="pb-2"> <strong>2. DFC (Distance From Close)</strong></h3>

      <p>
        <strong>DFC</strong> shows how far today's closing price is from the current
        <strong>Max Pain</strong>, expressed in percentage terms.
      </p>

      <p>
        It helps traders understand whether the market price is
        <strong>near</strong> or <strong>far</strong> from the option writers' comfort zone.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Lower DFC → Price is closer to Max Pain</li>
        <li>Higher DFC → Price is far away from Max Pain</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="pt-3">Formula</h4>
      <pre class="bg-light p-3 rounded border">
         DFC = (|Close − MP_today| / ATM_strike_gap) × 100
      </pre>

      <h4 class="pt-3">Example</h4>
      <p>Assume the following values:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Closing Price = <strong>25,950</strong></li>
        <li>Max Pain = <strong>25,400</strong></li>
        <li>ATM Strike Gap = <strong>250</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <pre class="bg-light p-3 rounded border">
         DFC = (|25,950 − 25,400| / 250) × 100
         DFC = (550 / 250) × 100
         DFC = 220%
      </pre>

      <p class="pt-3">
        <strong>Interpretation:</strong>  
        A DFC of <strong>220%</strong> means the price is very far from Max Pain,
        increasing the chance of mean reversion if market conditions support it.
      </p>
      <h3 class="pb-2"><strong>3. 7D Avg MP (7-Day Average Max Pain)</strong></h3>

  <p>
    <strong>7D Avg MP</strong> represents the average of Max Pain values from the
    last <strong>7 trading days</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead of relying on a single day's Max Pain, this value provides a
    <strong>smoother and more stable reference level</strong>.
  </p>

  <h4 class="pt-3">Formula</h4>
  <pre class="bg-light p-3 rounded border">
    7D Avg MP = Average(MP of last 7 trading days)
  </pre>

  <h4 class="pt-3">Example</h4>
  <p>If Max Pain values for the last 7 days are:</p>

  <pre class="bg-light p-3 rounded border">
    25,600 | 25,500 | 25,700 | 25,800 | 25,650 | 25,750 | 25,850
  </pre>

  <p>Then:</p>

  <pre class="bg-light p-3 rounded border">
    7D Avg MP ≈ 25,721(Approximate Value)
  </pre>

  <p class="pt-3">
    <strong>Interpretation:</strong>  
    The 7-day average Max Pain acts as a stronger support or resistance zone
    compared to a single-day Max Pain value.
    </p>


    <h3 class="pb-2"><strong>4. Reliability (7D)</strong></h3>

    <p>
        <strong>Reliability (7D)</strong> measures how trustworthy the
        <strong>7-day average Max Pain</strong> level is.
    </p>

    <p>
        It evaluates reliability by combining two key factors:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>How far the current price is from Max Pain</li>
        <li>How volatile Max Pain has been over the last 7 days</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        A higher reliability value means the Max Pain level is more stable
        and dependable. A lower value indicates uncertainty.
    </p>

    <h4 class="pt-3">Formula</h4>
    <pre class="bg-light p-3 rounded border">
    Reliability = 1 / (1 + (|Close − MP| / ATM_strike_gap) + (StdDev(MP_7D) / ATM_strike_gap))
    </pre>

    <h4 class="pt-3">Example</h4>
    <p>Assume the following values:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>|Close − Max Pain| = <strong>550</strong></li>
        <li>ATM Strike Gap = <strong>250</strong></li>
        <li>Standard Deviation of MP (7D) = <strong>300</strong></li>

    Reliability = 1 / 4.4
    Reliability ≈ 0.11 → 11%
    </pre>

    <p class="pt-3">
        <strong>Interpretation:</strong>  
        A reliability of <strong>11%</strong> suggests that the 7-day average
        Max Pain level is not very stable. Traders should avoid using it as a
        strong standalone support or resistance level.

      </p>

      <p>
        This provides a <strong>medium-term view</strong> of where option writers
        are most comfortable, filtering out short-term noise.
      </p>

      <h4 class="pt-3">Formula</h4>
      <pre class="bg-light p-3 rounded border">
        14D Avg MP = Average(MP of last 14 trading days)

        14D Avg MP ≈ 25,925
      </pre>

      <p class="pt-3">
        <strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
        The 14-day average Max Pain acts as a more stable reference level compared

      </p>
    <h3 class="pb-2"><strong>6. Reliability (14D)</strong></h3>

  <p>
    <strong>Reliability (14D)</strong> measures how dependable the

  </p>

  <p>
    It considers both the current price distance from Max Pain and the
    volatility of Max Pain over the last 14 days.

  </pre>

  <p class="pt-3">
    <strong>Interpretation:</strong>  
    A reliability of around <strong>11%</strong> suggests the 14-day Max Pain
    level has moderate stability and should be used along with other indicators.
  </p>
  <h3 class="pb-2"><strong>7. 21D Avg MP (21-Day Average Max Pain)</strong></h3>

<p>
  <strong>21D Avg MP</strong> represents the average Max Pain value of the 
  last <strong>21 trading days</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  This gives a <strong>positional or monthly-level</strong> view of where 
  option writers are most comfortable. It smooths out short-term fluctuations 
  and shows long-term sentiment.
</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">Formula</h4>
<pre class="bg-light p-3 rounded border">
21D Avg MP = Average(MP of last 21 trading days)

<p class="pt-3">
  <strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
  The 21-day average Max Pain acts as a strong and stable positional reference

        <p>
            To calculate max pain, you need to look at the open interest (OI) for all the call and put options at each
            strike price. Open interest is the total number of outstanding option contracts that have not been exercised
            or closed.</p>

        <h2>How to Read This Chart</h2>

        <p>
            This chart helps us understand how interest is distributed across different price levels.
            Each part of the chart represents a specific meaning.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>X-axis (Horizontal Axis):</strong><br>
                Shows the strike prices such as <strong>100, 110, and 120</strong>.
                These are the price levels where traders have placed their expectations.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Y-axis (Vertical Axis):</strong><br>
                Represents <strong>Open Interest</strong>, which means how many active positions
                exist at each strike price.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            By comparing the height of the bars at each strike price, we can understand
            where interest is balanced and where it is heavily concentrated.

        <h3> Case 1: Strike 100</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Very high interest on the upper-side expectation</li>
            <li>Very few people expect the price to stay below this level</li>

<h4 class="pt-3"><strong>1. How to Read This Chart</strong></h4>

<p>
  The <strong>X-axis</strong> (horizontal) represents time,
  showing trading days from left to right.
</p>

<p>
  The <strong>Left Y-axis</strong> shows the <strong>Max Pain strike levels</strong>,
  which correspond to the <strong>blue line</strong>.

<p>
  The <strong>Right Y-axis</strong> shows the <strong>stock’s market price (LTP)</strong>,
  which corresponds to the <strong>grey dotted line</strong>.
</p>
<h4 class="pt-3"><strong>2. What Each Line Shows</strong></h4>

<h5 class="pt-2"><strong> Blue Line – Max Pain Strike</strong></h5>

<p>
  The blue line represents the <strong>Max Pain level</strong> for each trading day.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>It changes based on option open interest distribution</li>
  <li>Moves slowly compared to price</li>
  <li>Acts as a <strong>reference or gravity level</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
  A flat blue line indicates stable option positioning.
  Sharp changes suggest shifting option writer expectations.
</p>

<h5 class="pt-3"><strong>Grey Dotted Line – Stock LTP</strong></h5>

<p>
  The grey dotted line shows the <strong>actual market price (Last Traded Price)</strong>
  of the stock or index.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Moves faster and more frequently</li>
  <li>Reflects real-time buying and selling</li>
  <li>Can move above or below Max Pain</li>

  The <strong>LTP</strong> shows the most recent traded price of the option.
  Along with it, the arrow and number indicate how much the price has
  <strong>increased or decreased</strong> compared to the previous session.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Green ↑ → Price has increased</li>
  <li>Red ↓ → Price has decreased</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This helps you quickly understand whether buyers or sellers were dominant.
</p>

<h5 class="pt-3"><strong>Open Interest (OI)</strong></h5>

<p>
  <strong>Open Interest</strong> shows the total number of active option contracts.
  The change value indicates whether positions are being:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Added</strong> (increase in OI)</li>
  <li><strong>Unwound</strong> (decrease in OI)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This gives insight into <strong>trader commitment</strong> at that strike.
</p>

<h4 class="pt-3"><strong>How to Analyze This Data</strong></h4>

<p>
  By comparing <strong>CE vs PE</strong> data at the same strike, you can:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>See where traders are building positions</li>
  <li>Identify bullish or bearish bias at that level</li>
  <li>Confirm whether Max Pain is supported by option activity</li>
</ul>

<p>
  For example:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>CE price falling with rising OI → Call writing (bearish pressure)</li>
  <li>PE price rising with rising OI → Put buying (downside protection)</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="pt-3"><strong>Why This Section Is Important</strong></h4>

  section reveals the <strong>actual behavior of traders</strong> at each strike.

  <strong>more informed trading decisions</strong>.

        <h3 class="pb-2">Why Is It Called “Pain”?</h3>
        <p>
            It is called <strong>Max Pain</strong> because it shows the price level where
            option buyers feel the most pain by losing most of the premiums they paid.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the same level, sellers feel the least pain because
            they are able to keep most of the money they collected.
        </p>

        <h3 class="pb-2">How Traders Actually Use Max Pain</h3>
        <p>
            Some traders use Max Pain only as a <strong>reference level</strong>,
            especially near expiry, to check whether the price is moving
            toward or away from it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Max Pain is often combined with other market information such as:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Support and resistance levels</li>
            <li>Open interest build-up</li>
            <li>Market trend</li>
            <li>Trading volume</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Max Pain is one tool for expiry analysis, not a stand-alone signal to buy or sell.</strong>
                
            
        </p>

        <h3 class="pb-2">Limitations of Max Pain</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Max Pain can change when open interest changes, so it is not a fixed level.
            </li>
            <li>
                Big news events, price gaps, or strong trends can move the market far away
                from the Max Pain level.
            </li>
            <li>
                Max Pain only shows where losses would be highest if the price closes there;
                it does not guarantee that the price will move to that level.
            </li>
        </ul>
