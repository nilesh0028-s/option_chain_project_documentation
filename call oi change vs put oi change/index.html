        <h3> Column Explanation</h3>

        <h3 class="pb-2">Time</h3>
        <p>
           The timestamp when the data was recorded. Each row represents data at different intervals during the trading
            day (15:30, 15:15, 15:00, 14:45, etc.).
        </p>

        <h4>Spot LTP</h4>
        <p>
            Nifty 50 last traded price at that time.
            The green/red tag below shows how much it changed from the previous interval
            and the percentage move.
        </p>

        <h4>PE OI Chg</h4>
        <p>
            Net change in put open interest in this strike range compared to the start of the day.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Positive value:</b> Puts are being added (fresh put positions).</li>
            <li><b>Negative value (as in your screenshot):</b> Puts are being unwound/closed.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Example (15:30):</b></p>
        <p>
            PE OI Chg = 18,32,104 with a ↓ of –7,06,896 from the previous reading →
            total intraday put buildup is still 18.3L above the morning level,
            but 7.06L has been cut since the prior interval.
        </p>

        <h4>CE OI Chg</h4>
        <p>
            Net change in call open interest compared to the start of the day.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Positive value:</b> Calls being added.</li>
            <li><b>Negative value:</b> Calls being unwound.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Example (15:30):</b></p>
        <p>
            CE OI Chg = 23,78,918 with ↓ –9,48,685 →
            still large net call buildup on the day,
            but heavy profit-booking/unwinding into the close.
        </p>

        <h4>Difference</h4>
        <p>
            PE OI Chg – CE OI Chg for that time range.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Negative value</b> (like –5,46,814 at 15:30) means call change &gt; put change,
                so intraday additions are more on the call side.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Positive value</b> would mean put change &gt; call change.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This tells you which side is dominating fresh intraday positions.
        </p>

        <h4>PCR (Change-based)</h4>
        <p>
            Here PCR is calculated using PE OI Chg ÷ CE OI Chg for the selected range.
        </p>
        <p>
            PCR around 0.77–0.81 in your rows means fresh call activity is higher than fresh put activity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Values below 1 imply intraday traders are more aggressive on calls than on puts
            (short-term bullishness).
        </p>

        <h4>Intraday PCR</h4>
        <p>
            On this page, Intraday PCR is effectively the same concept,
            focusing purely on today’s change/volume in puts vs calls
            (not cumulative total OI).
            In your screenshot it matches PCR (0.77, 0.76, 0.81, 0.79),
            reinforcing the same sentiment: more call buildup intraday.
        </p>

        <h4>Max Pain</h4>
        <p>
             the strike where total option buyers would lose the most at expiry
            (here 25,900 in all rows).
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                When shown in <b>green</b>, max pain is above current LTP
                (price below the magnet level).
            </li>
            <li>
                When shown in <b>red</b>, max pain would be below LTP
                (price above the magnet level).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In this image, Nifty is near 25,860–25,887, and Max Pain is 25,900,
            so it appears green, indicating price is just below that max-pain strike.
        </p>
