        <h4 class="pb-2"> <strong>1.</strong> What is LOT</h4> 
        <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
            In the options market, you cannot buy or sell NIFTY one-by-one. The exchange allows trading only in fixed bundles. That fixed bundle is called a LOT.
        </p>

        <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
            For NIFTY: <strong>1 LOT = 65 NIFTY units</strong> means:
            This lot size (65) is fixed by the exchange,
            not by traders.
        </p>

        <h4 class="pb-2"><strong>2.</strong> Put Call Ratio</h4>
        <p class="pb-2 fs-5">Put–Call Ratio (PCR) is a market‑sentiment indicator that compares how many put options are being traded (or
            are open) to how many call options are being traded (or are open) for the same index or stock. It tells you
            whether traders, as a group, are more focused on protection/downside (puts) or on upside (calls).</p>
         <h5 class="pb-2">Formula of Put–Call Ratio (PCR)</h5>

        <p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
        <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
            Put–Call Ratio (PCR) = Total Put Open Interest ÷ Total Call Open Interest
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

        <ul class="pb-2 fs-5">
            <li>Total Put Open Interest = 24,00,000</li>
            <li>Total Call Open Interest = 20,00,000</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
            <strong>Calculation:</strong><br>
            PCR = 24,00,000 ÷ 20,00,000 = <strong>1.20</strong>
        </p>

        <h3 class="pb-2">What PCR Values Mean?</h3>

    <h3 class="pb-2"> <strong>3.</strong> Max Pain</h3>
    <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
        Max Pain is the price level at which the maximum number of option buyers (both CALL and PUT) lose money at expiry, 
        because most options expire worthless, allowing option sellers to earn the highest profit.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
        <strong>Price breakdown:</strong><br>
        Above this price – most CALL buyers lose<br>
        Below this price – most PUT buyers lose<br>
        Near this price – both CALL and PUT buyers lose
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
        This is why prices often move or settle near the Max Pain level close to expiry,
        especially in non-trending markets.
    </p>
    <h3 class="pb-2"> <strong>4.</strong> Futures Price(FUT)</h3>

    <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
        Futures Price is the price at which traders are currently willing to buy or sell NIFTY for a future date,
        and it reflects the expectation and direction of big traders in the market.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
        <strong>Price breakdown:</strong><br>
        Falling futures price – selling pressure and bearish expectation<br>
        Rising futures price – buying pressure and bullish expectation<br>
        Large price movement – strong conviction by big players
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
        Since futures are mainly traded by institutions,
        the futures price often leads the spot market and signals direction early.
    </p>
       <h4 class="pb-2"> <strong>5.</strong> NIFTY (Spot Price)</h4>

      <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
         NIFTY Spot Price is the current real market value of the NIFTY index,
         calculated from the prices of its underlying stocks,
         and it represents the actual position of the market at that moment.
      </p>
    <h4 class="pb-2"><strong>6.</strong> IN LOT</h4>

    <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
        IN LOT is a display setting that converts option data from raw numbers into lot-based values,
        making it easier to read, compare, and understand the actual trading size.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
        <strong>Data breakdown:</strong><br>
        OFF – values are shown as total quantity<br>
        ON – values are shown as number of lots<br>
        Same data, different display format
    </p>

    <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
        This setting helps traders quickly understand position size
        without dealing with large and confusing numbers.

        <h2 class="pb-2 border-bottom">What is an Option?</h2>
        <p>
            An option is a special contract that connects two people: a buyer and a seller. It gives the buyer a choice
            (a right), not a compulsion, to buy or to sell something (like Nifty or a stock) at a fixed price within a
            limited time. The fixed price is the strike price, and the last date to use this choice is the expiry date.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-4 pb-2 border-bottom">What is Option Chain?</h2>
        <p>An option chain is simply a big list of all the options available for one stock or index, shown together in a
            table.
        <p>

        <p>
            For one particular expiry date, it shows every strike price and, for each strike, the call options on one
            side and the put options on the other side. Next to each strike, the table shows useful numbers like the
            last traded price, how many contracts traded today, and how many contracts are still open. By looking at
            this one screen, a trader can quickly compare different strikes and see where most buying and selling
            interest is, instead of checking each option one by one.

        <h3 class="mt-4">Types of Options</h3>
        <p><b>Call Options and Put Options.</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Call Option:</b> A call option gives the buyer the right to buy an asset at a specified price within
                a specific time period. Buyers of call options expect the price of the underlying asset to rise.</li>
            <li><b>Put Option:</b> A put option gives the buyer the right to sell an asset at a specified price within a
                specific time period. Buyers of put options expect the price of the underlying asset to fall.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="mt-4">What Happens at Expiry</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>On the expiry day, you check: "Is it useful to use my right or not?"</li>
            <li>If the market price makes your right beneficial, you use it.</li>
            <li>If the market price makes your right useless, you do nothing and let the option expire.</li>
            <li>In the worst case, your loss is only the premium you paid at the start.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="mt-4">Example: Call option</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Nifty is at 22,000</li>
            <li>You buy a call option with strike 22,000 and pay a premium of 100 points.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-3">Case 1: Market goes up</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>At expiry, Nifty becomes 22,300.</li>
            <li>Your contract allows you to "buy at 22,000" while the market is 22,300.</li>
            <li>The option is worth about 300 points (22,300 - 22,000).</li>
            <li>Your profit is roughly 300 - 100 = 200 points.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-3">Case 2: Market goes down</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>At expiry, Nifty becomes 21,700.</li>
            <li>Your right to buy at 22,000 is now useless.</li>
            <li>You simply don't use the option.</li>
            <li>Your loss is only the 100-point premium you paid.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="mt-4">Example: Put option</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Nifty is at 22,000.</li>
            <li>You buy a put option with strike 22,000 and pay a premium of 100 points.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-3">Case 1: Market falls</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>At expiry, Nifty falls to 21,500.</li>
            <li>Your contract allows you to "sell at 22,000".</li>
            <li>The option is worth about 500 points.</li>
            <li>After subtracting the premium, your profit is 500 - 100 = 400 points.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-3">Case 2: Market rises</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>At expiry, Nifty goes up to 22,500.</li>
            <li>Your right to sell at 22,000 is useless.</li>
            <li>You let the option expire.</li>
            <li>Your loss is only the 100-point premium.</li>

        <h3 class="pb-2"> <strong>1.</strong>Strike Price</h3>
        <p class="pb-2 fs-5">Strike price is the fixed price written in the option contract at which you can buy or sell the underlying
            asset, depending on whether it is a call or a put option.</p>
        <p class="pb-2 fs-5">In an option chain, each row has one strike price like 21,800 or 22,000. This number is the agreed price for
            the deal: for a call option it is the price at which you have the right to buy, and for a put option it is
            the price at which you have the right to sell. The strike stays constant from the day the option is created
            until expiry, even though the market price keeps moving up and down. How far the market is from the strike
            helps decide whether the option is cheap or costly and whether it is in-the-money, at-the-money, or
            out-of-the-money.</p>
        <h3 class="pb-2"><strong>2.</strong> OI PCR (Open Interest Put–Call Ratio)</h3>
        <ul class="pb-2 fs-5">
            <li>OI PCR compares total put open interest to total call open interest for an index or stock.</li>

        <ul class="pb-2 fs-5">
            <li>Total Put OI = 150,000 contracts</li>
            <li>Total Call OI = 100,000 contracts</li>
            <li>
                Apply formula:<br>
                OI PCR = Total Put OI ÷ Total Call OI
            </li>
            <li>
                OI PCR = 150,000 ÷ 100,000 = 1.5
            </li>
            <li>
                Interpretation: OI PCR is above 1 → more put OI than call OI → traders are expecting a downside.

        <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
            <strong>How to read:</strong><br>
            100% → Only one side is present<br>
            80–99% → One side is dominating<br>
            Around 50% → Both sides are equal
        </p>

        <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
            <strong>Simple idea:</strong><br>
            The side with higher Open Interest is the stronger side.
        </p>

        <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
            <strong>Formula:</strong><br>
            OI Str = (Higher OI ÷ Total OI) × 100

        <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
            Vol PCR shows <strong>where today's trading activity is happening more</strong>.

            Vol PCR &gt; 1 → More Put trading<br>

    <h3 class="pb-2">Change</h3>
     <p>
         LTP Change shows how much the latest price has moved compared to an earlier reference price.
     </p>

     <ul>
         <li>
             <strong>Formula:</strong>
             LTP Change = Today's Current LTP - Yesterday's Closing Price
         </li>

         <li>
             If LTP Change is positive, the option is trading higher than before (price has gone
             up).
         </li>

         <li>
             If LTP Change is negative, the option is trading lower than before (price has gone down).
         </li>
     </ul>
       <h3 class="pb-2">Last Traded Price(LTP)</h3>
        <p>It is the price of the most recent trade that happened in that option or stock on the exchange. Whenever a
            new trade is executed, that deal's price becomes the new LTP, so it always shows the latest price at which
            buyers and sellers actually agreed.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="pb-2">VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)</h3>
        <p>VWAP tells you the average price at which most of the trading happened during the whole day.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Price above VWAP → buyers strong → indicates bullishness.</li>
            <li>Price below VWAP → sellers strong → indicates bearishness.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="pb-2">LTP VWAP %</h3>
        <p>
            LTP VWAP % shows how far the current Last Traded Price is from today’s VWAP in percentage terms.​
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Common formula</strong><br>
                LTP VWAP % = (LTP − VWAP) / VWAP × 100
            </li>

            <li>
                If LTP is above VWAP, this percentage will be positive; it tells you how many percent the latest price
                is above the average traded price.​
            </li>

            <li>
                If LTP is below VWAP, the percentage will be negative; it shows how much cheaper the latest trade is
                compared to the day’s average.​
            </li>

            <li>
                A small number (like +0.5%) means LTP is close to VWAP; a big number (like +5% or −5%) means price has
                moved far away from the average, which some traders see as overbought / oversold intraday.​
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>LTP (Last Traded Price) = 105</li>
            <li>VWAP = 100</li>
            <li>
                Apply formula:<br>
                LTP VWAP % = (LTP − VWAP) / VWAP × 100
            </li>
            <li>
                LTP VWAP % = (105 − 100) / 100 × 100 = 5%
            </li>
            <li>
                This means: LTP is 5% above the VWAP (buyers stronger).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="pb-2">VWAP Change</h3>
        <p>
            VWAP Change tells you how much today’s VWAP has moved compared to a previous reference VWAP, usually
            yesterday’s VWAP for the same option.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Formula:</strong><br>
                VWAP Change = Today’s VWAP − Yesterday’s VWAP
            </li>

            <li>
                If VWAP Change is positive → today’s average traded price is higher than yesterday’s average (buyers
                were willing to pay more).
            </li>

            <li>
                If VWAP Change is negative → today’s average traded price is lower than yesterday’s average (sellers
                accepted lower prices).
            </li>

            <li>
                VWAP Change with volume helps show whether the market’s “fair” traded level is shifting up or down with
                strength.
            </li>
        </ul>
         <h3 class="pb-2">Implied Volatility(IV)</h3>

        <p>
            Implied Volatility (IV) tells you how much the market expects the price of the stock or index to move in the
            future.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                IV does not tell you whether the price will go up or down, only how big the move might be.
            </li>

            <li>
                IV is shown as a percentage per year (for example, 15%, 20%, 30%).
            </li>

            <li>
                A higher IV means the market expects bigger swings and more uncertainty.
            </li>

            <li>
                A lower IV means the market expects smaller moves and more stable prices.
            </li>

            <li>
                When IV is high, options usually become more expensive because the chance of a big move is higher.
            </li>

            <li>
                When IV is low, options become cheaper because big moves are less expected.

        <h3 class="pb-2">Volume</h3>
        <p>
            Volume is the total number of contracts traded today for that specific option (that strike and expiry).
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Every time one buyer and one seller complete a trade, volume increases by 1 contract.</li>
            <li>Volume counts all trades, whether they are opening new positions or closing old ones.</li>
            <li>High volume means that option is actively traded and it is easier to enter and exit.</li>
            <li>Very low volume means fewer traders are interested there, so the bid-ask spread can be wide.</li>
            <li>Volume resets to zero every new trading day and builds up through the day.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="pb-2">Change in OI(Open interest)</h3>
        <p>
            Change in OI (Change in Open Interest) shows how much the number of open contracts has gone up or down
            compared to the previous day.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Open Interest is the total number of contracts that are still open and not closed.
            </li>

            <li>
                Change in OI formula:<br>
                <strong>Change in OI = Today's OI - Yesterday's OI</strong>
            </li>

            <li>
                If Change in OI is positive → new positions were added (more contracts are now open).
            </li>

            <li>
                If Change in OI is negative → traders closed positions (fewer contracts left open).
            </li>

            <li>
                A big positive Change in OI with good volume means fresh money is entering that strike.
            </li>

            <li>
                A big negative Change in OI means traders are exiting that strike and interest is decreasing.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="pb-2">OI(Open interest)</h3>
        <p>
            Open interest (OI) tells you how many option contracts are currently "alive" for a particular strike and
            expiry.
        </p>
        <p>
            In simple words, it is the count of all contracts that have been created but not yet closed, squared off, or
            expired. If new traders open fresh positions, open interest goes up; when traders close their existing
            positions, open interest goes down.
        </p>
        <p>
            A high OI at a strike usually means many traders are interested and the option is more liquid, so it is
            easier to buy and sell there.
        </p>
    <h3 class="pb-2">OI Percent</h3>
    <p>OI Percent shows how much OI increased or decreased today in percentage.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>If OI increased from 1,00,000 to 1,10,000 → OI Percent = +10%</li>
        <li>If OI fell from 1,00,000 to 90,000 → OI Percent = –10%</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="pb-2">OI Percentile</h3>
    <p>OI Percentile tells you how high or low today’s OI is compared to its past levels.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>If OI Percentile is <strong>90%</strong> → Today’s OI is higher than 90% of previous days → very high →
            strong interest.</li>
        <li>If OI Percentile is <strong>10%</strong> → Today’s OI is higher than only 10% of previous days → very
            low → weak interest.</li>
    </ul>
        <h3 class="pb-2">Built-up</h3>
        <p>
            Built-up in an option chain tells you what kind of positions are getting created or closed at a strike
            by looking at price + OI together. It is usually shown as four types:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Long Buildup</strong>

                    <li>New buyers are entering and holding positions.</li>
                    <li>Generally indicates bullish interest at that strike.</li>

                <strong>Short Buildup</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Price goes down and Open Interest goes up.</li>
                    <li>New sellers (shorts) are entering and holding positions.</li>
                    <li>Usually indicates bearish sentiment.</li>

                    <li>Traders who were short are closing their positions.</li>
                    <li>Often seen when a down-move is ending or reversing.</li>

            </li>
            <li>Higher volatility makes options more expensive; lower volatility makes them cheaper.</li>
            <li>Example: Vega = 2.5 means if IV goes from 20% to 21%, the option price is expected to increase by about
                2.5 points.</li>
            <li>Options with more time to expiry and near-the-money strikes usually have higher vega.</li>
        </ul>  
        <h3 class="pb-2"><strong>25.</strong> Gamma</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Gamma tells how much delta itself will change when the underlying moves by 1 point.</li>
            <li>If delta is “speed” of the option, gamma is the “acceleration” – how quickly that speed changes.</li>
            <li>Example: A call has delta 0.40 and gamma 0.05. If Nifty goes up 1 point, new delta ≈ 0.45 (0.40 + 0.05).
                If it goes up another 1 point, delta may rise again to about 0.50.</li>
            <li>Gamma is usually highest for options near the current market price and close to expiry, because there
                the option’s behaviour can flip quickly between acting like “almost worthless” and “very valuable”.</li>
        </ul>
         <h3 class="pb-2"><strong>26.</strong> Theta – effect of time (time decay)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Theta shows how much an option's value is expected to decrease each day just because time is passing.
            </li>
            <li>For option buyers, theta is usually negative → the option loses value daily.</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Theta = −3 → if all else stays the same, the option loses about <strong>3
                    points in value per day</strong>.</li>
            <li>Time decay accelerates as the expiry date approaches, especially for
                options near the money.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="pb-2"><strong>27.</strong> Delta – effect of price change</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Delta tells how much the option price is expected to move if the underlying moves by 1 point.</li>
            <li>Call options have positive delta (they gain when price goes up); put options have negative delta (they
                gain when price goes down).</li>
            <li>Example: If a call has delta 0.40 and Nifty moves up 1 point, the option price is expected to go up
                about 0.40 points.</li>
            <li>A delta close to 0 means the option hardly reacts to small price moves; a delta close to 1 (or −1 for
                puts) means it moves almost point‑for‑point with the underlying.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="pb-2">Relationships Between all Greeks?</h3>
        <h4 class="pb-2">Delta and Gamma</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Delta is “first reaction” of the option price when the underlying moves; Gamma is how fast that reaction
                itself changes.</li>
            <li>When Gamma is high, Delta can jump quickly with even a small move in the underlying, so the option
                becomes very sensitive.</li>
            <li>When Gamma is low, Delta changes slowly and the option behaves more steadily.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="pb-2">Gamma and Theta</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Options with high Gamma (very responsive to price moves) usually have high Theta (they lose value faster
                with time).</li>
            <li>This is the trade‑off: if you want strong benefit from small price moves (high Gamma), you must accept
                faster time decay (more negative Theta).</li>
            <li>Deep in‑the‑money or far out‑of‑the‑money options normally have lower Gamma and also lower Theta
                compared to at‑the‑money options.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="pb-2">Vega with Delta and Gamma</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Vega measures sensitivity to implied volatility; when implied volatility changes, it also affects Delta
                and Gamma.</li>
            <li>If volatility increases, option prices rise and both calls and puts tend to have Deltas move closer to
                0.5 (more uncertainty), and Gamma around the money often increases.</li>
            <li>If volatility falls, Deltas of in‑the‑money options move closer to 1 (or −1 for puts) and Deltas of
                out‑of‑the‑money options move closer to 0, while Gamma around the money tends to drop.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="pb-2">Time to expiry and all Greeks</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>With more time left to expiry, Deltas are softer (closer to 0.5), Gamma is smaller, Theta is slower, and
                Vega is larger.</li>
            <li>As expiry gets closer, Deltas move quickly toward 1 or 0, Gamma spikes near the money, Theta decay
                speeds up there, and Vega shrinks.</li>
            <li>So time passing doesn’t only increase Theta decay; it also reshapes Delta, Gamma, and Vega together.
            </li>
        </ul>
