            The chart you're looking at shows real-time dynamics between call and put option activity for Nifty 50 ,with data recorded every 15 minutes(9:15 AM to 3:30 PM market hours).
        </p>
       <h4 class="pb-2">Chart Explanation</h4>
        <h5 class="pb-2"> <strong>Green Line – CE OI (Call Open Interest Change)</strong></h5>
  <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
    Represents the intraday change in <strong>Call Open Interest</strong>.
  </p>
  <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
    The green line stays consistently above the red line for most of the session,
    indicating <strong>stronger call-side activity</strong>.
  </p>
  <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
    A steady rise, especially after mid-day, shows <strong>continuous addition of Call positions</strong>,
    mainly by <strong>option writers</strong>.
  </p>

  <h5 class="pb-2"><strong>Red Line – PE OI (Put Open Interest Change)</strong></h5>
  <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
    Represents the intraday change in <strong>Put Open Interest</strong>.
  </p>
  <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
    Although PE OI increased in the first half, it <strong>failed to keep pace with CE OI</strong>
    later in the session.
  </p>
  <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
    The gradual decline toward the end suggests <strong>reduced put writing or partial unwinding</strong>.
  </p>

  <h5 class="pb-2"><strong>Grey Line – Stock LTP (NIFTY Spot Price)</strong></h5>
  <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
    Shows <strong>NIFTY’s intraday price movement</strong>.
  </p>
  <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
    Price peaked early, then moved <strong>downward and sideways</strong>,
    failing to sustain higher levels.
  </p>
  <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
    This price behavior aligns with <strong>heavy call writing pressure</strong>.

         <h4 class="pb-2"><strong>1. Time</strong></h4>
        <p>
            The timestamp when the data was recorded. Each row represents data at different intervals during the trading
            day (15:30, 15:15, 15:00, 14:45, etc.).

            The actual price at which Nifty 50 was trading at that specific time. For example, at 15:30 (market close),
            Nifty was at 25,694.35. <em>The colored arrow (↓ or ↑) </em> shows if it moved up or down from the previous
            interval,

            <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
                The total number of put option contracts still open (not closed or exercised) at that time, expressed in
                the
                given strike range. For example, at 15:30, there were 20,34,975 put contracts outstanding. The red
                number
                with ↓ shows it decreased by -3,06,686 contracts since the last interval.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
               <strong> Why It Matters:</strong> Rising PE OI suggests traders are becoming more defensive. Falling PE OI suggests
                they're exiting bearish positions.
            </p>
             <h3 class="pb-2 fs-5"><strong>4. CE OI (Call Option Open Interest)</strong></h3>
            <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
                The total number of call option contracts still open at that time. For example, at 15:30, there were
                31,23,262 call contracts outstanding. The red number with ↓ shows it decreased by -4,23,798 contracts.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
                Why It Matters: Rising CE OI suggests bullish optimism. Falling CE OI suggests traders are trimming long
                bets.

            <h3 class="pb-2"><strong>5. Difference (CE OI vs PE OI)</strong></h3>

                <strong>Difference</strong> shows the net gap between

                <li>
                    <strong>Negative value (−)</strong> → CE OI is higher than PE OI  
                    <br>→ Call side dominance  
                    <br>→ Possible resistance or bearish bias

                <li>
                    <strong>Positive value (+)</strong> → PE OI is higher than CE OI

                PE OI = 20,34,975<br>
                CE OI = 31,23,262<br><br>
                Difference = 20,34,975 − 31,23,262<br>
                Difference = −10,88,287
            </p>

            <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
                <strong>Conclusion:</strong> A negative difference means the call side is stronger,
                indicating resistance in that zone.

            <p class="pb-2 fs-5">Put–Call Ratio (PCR) is a market‑sentiment indicator that compares how many put options are being traded
                (or
                are open) to how many call options are being traded (or are open) for the same index or stock. It tells

            <p>Intraday PCR measures the ratio of today’s put option activity to today’s call option activity within the
                trading day. Usually it is calculated using today’s traded volume (or today’s change in OI) of puts
                divided by today’s traded volume (or change in OI) of calls for that day. It tells you what traders are
                doing right now during the session, not what they have built over many days.</p>
            <h3 class="pb-2">Formula and Difference from Normal PCR</h3>

            <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
                <strong>Normal PCR</strong> on your NiftyInvest screen uses total PE OI ÷ total CE OI for that expiry
                and range.
            </p>

            <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
                <strong>Intraday PCR</strong> uses today’s fresh build-up or volume in PE ÷ today’s fresh build-up or
                volume in CE for the same period.
            </p>


            <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
                
              <p> <strong>So:</strong></p>
    
                If <strong>Intraday PCR</strong> is very high, it means that today more puts are being added or traded
                than calls, showing strong fear/bearish hedging intraday (often a contrarian bullish hint if extreme).
            </p>

            <p class="pb-2 fs-5">
                If <strong>Intraday PCR</strong> is very low, it means today traders are aggressively taking call
                positions compared to puts, showing intraday bullishness that can become over-optimistic at extremes.
            </p>

        <h3 class="pb-2"><strong>8. Max Pain</strong></h3>
        <p class="pb-2 fs-5">Max pain (in options) is the strike price at which option buyers (calls + puts together) would lose the most money at expiry, and option sellers would gain the most.</p>
        <ul class="pb-2 fs-5">
            <li>If max pain is below the current LTP, it is shown in red (price trading above the max‑pain level).</li>
            <li>
                If max pain is above the current LTP, it is shown in green (price trading below the max‑pain level).
