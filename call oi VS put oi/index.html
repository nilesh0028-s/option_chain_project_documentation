        <h3 class="pb-3S border-bottom"> Why Do We Use This Tool?</h3>
        <p>
            Traders and investors use the CALL OI vs PUT OI analysis to understand market psychology and sentiment. When
            you know whether traders are buying more call options (bullish bets) or put options (bearish bets), you can
            gauge what the smart money believes will happen next. This helps you make better trading decisions—whether
            to go long, go short, or stay cautious. It's essentially reading the market's collective mind through option
            positioning data.

        <h3 class="pb-2 border-bottom"> Breaking Down the Chart</h3>
        <p>
            The chart you're looking at shows real-time dynamics between call and put option activity for Nifty 50
            expiring on 16-DEC-2025 between the levels of 23,950 to 27,950, with data recorded every 15 minutes
            (9:15 AM to 3:30 PM market hours).</p>
        </h3>
        <h3 class="pb-2 border-bottom"> The Visual Elements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Green Line (CE OI):</strong>
                Shows Call Option Open Interest over time — the total number of unexercised call contracts.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Red Line (PE OI):</strong>
                Shows Put Option Open Interest over time — the total number of unexercised put contracts.

            <li>
                <strong>Gray Line (Stock LTP):</strong>
                Represents the actual Nifty 50 spot price movement throughout the trading day.

            <li>
                <strong>Bar Chart (Left):</strong>
                A summary showing end-of-session Open Interest:
                <ul>
                    <li>CE OI = <strong>23.15 Lakhs</strong></li>
                    <li>PE OI = <strong>28.08 Lakhs</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p> <strong> What This Reveals:</strong> The chart shows that put options have higher cumulative positioning
            (red line stays above green) throughout most of the day, suggesting traders were more defensive/bearish,
            expecting potential downside moves.</p>

        <h2 class="pb-2">Column Explanation</h2>

        <h3 class="pb-2">Time</h3>
        <p>
            The timestamp when the data was recorded. Each row represents data at different intervals during the trading
            day (15:30, 15:15, 15:00, 14:45, etc.).
        </p>

        <h3 class="pb-2">Spot LTP (Last Traded Price)</h3>
        <p>
            The actual price at which Nifty 50 was trading at that specific time. For example, at 15:30 (market close),
            Nifty was at 26,027.30. <em>The colored arrow (↓ or ↑) </em> shows if it moved up or down from the previous
            interval,
            with the percentage change in parentheses.
        </p>

        <h3 class="pb-2">PE OI (Put Option Open Interest)</h4>
            <p>
                The total number of put option contracts still open (not closed or exercised) at that time, expressed in
                the
                given strike range. For example, at 15:30, there were 28,07,856 put contracts outstanding. The red
                number
                with ↓ shows it decreased by 4,13,443 contracts since the last interval.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why It Matters: Rising PE OI suggests traders are becoming more defensive. Falling PE OI suggests
                they're
                exiting bearish positions.
            </p>

            <h3 class="pb-2"> CE OI (Call Option Open Interest)</h3>
            <p>
                The total number of call option contracts still open at that time. For example, at 15:30, there were
                23,15,018 call contracts outstanding. The red number with ↓ shows it decreased by 2,86,328 contracts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why It Matters: Rising CE OI suggests bullish optimism. Falling CE OI suggests traders are trimming long
                bets.
            </p>

            <h3 class="pb-2">Difference (PE OI - CE OI)</h3>
            <p>
                Shows how much higher put interest is compared to call interest. At 15:30, puts exceeded calls by
                4,92,838
                contracts. A positive number means puts dominate (bearish bias), while a negative number would mean
                calls
                dominate (bullish bias).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Trading Insight: </strong> Large positive differences suggest traders expect a potential
                downside move or protection
                against losses.
            </p>
            <h3 class="pb-2 border-bottom">PCR</h3>
            <p>Put–Call Ratio (PCR) is a market‑sentiment indicator that compares how many put options are being traded
                (or
                are open) to how many call options are being traded (or are open) for the same index or stock. It tells
                you
                whether traders, as a group, are more focused on protection/downside (puts) or on upside (calls).</p>
            <h3 class="pb-2">Formula of Put–Call Ratio (PCR)</h3>

            <p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
            <p>
                Put–Call Ratio (PCR) = Total Put Open Interest ÷ Total Call Open Interest
            </p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Total Put Open Interest = 24,00,000</li>
                <li>Total Call Open Interest = 20,00,000</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>Calculation:</strong><br>
                PCR = 24,00,000 ÷ 20,00,000 = <strong>1.20</strong>
            </p>

            <h3 class="pb-2 border-bottom">What PCR Values Mean?</h3>
            <table class="table table-bordered">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>PCR Range</th>
                        <th>Market View</th>

                </tbody>
            </table>
            <h3 class="pb-2">Intraday PCR</h3>
            <p>Intraday PCR measures the ratio of today’s put option activity to today’s call option activity within the
                trading day. Usually it is calculated using today’s traded volume (or today’s change in OI) of puts
                divided by today’s traded volume (or change in OI) of calls for that day. It tells you what traders are
                doing right now during the session, not what they have built over many days.</p>
            <h3 class="pb-2">Formula and Difference from Normal PCR</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>Normal PCR</strong> on your NiftyInvest screen uses total PE OI ÷ total CE OI for that expiry
                and range.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Intraday PCR</strong> uses today’s fresh build-up or volume in PE ÷ today’s fresh build-up or
                volume in CE for the same period.
            </p>


            <p>
                
              <p> <strong>So:</strong></p>
    
                If <strong>Intraday PCR</strong> is very high, it means that today more puts are being added or traded
                than calls, showing strong fear/bearish hedging intraday (often a contrarian bullish hint if extreme).
            </p>

            <p>
                If <strong>Intraday PCR</strong> is very low, it means today traders are aggressively taking call
                positions compared to puts, showing intraday bullishness that can become over-optimistic at extremes.
            </p>

        <h3 class="pb-2">Max Pain </h3>
        <p>Max pain (in options) is the strike price at which option buyers (calls + puts together) would lose the most money at expiry, and option sellers would gain the most.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If max pain is below the current LTP, it is shown in red (price trading above the max‑pain level).</li>
            <li>
                If max pain is above the current LTP, it is shown in green (price trading below the max‑pain level).
            </li>
        </ul>
