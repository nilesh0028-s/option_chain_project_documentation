        <p>A FutureChain chain shows the list of available future contracts for a stock/index across different expiray
            date.</p>
        <h3 class="pb-2 border-bottom">What is Future Contract?</h3>
        <p>A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a specific future
            date. Unlike spot trading (buying and selling today), futures allow you to trade based on where you expect
            prices to go in the future.</p>

            <h3 class="pb-2">Coloum Explanation</h3>

            <h4 class="pb-2">Expiry</h4>
            <p>
                This column shows the contract expiration dates. Each row represents a different futures contract.
                In your screenshot, you can see contracts expiring on <b>30-DEC-2025</b>, <b>27-JAN-2026</b>, and
                <b>24-FEB-2026</b>.
                After the expiry date, the contract automatically closes and settles at the spot price.
            </p>

            <h4 class="pb-2">OI (Open Interest)</h4>
            <p>
                Open Interest represents the total number of outstanding futures contracts that haven't been closed or
                settled yet.
                A high OI indicates that many traders are actively holding positions in that contract.
                In your data, the <b>30-DEC-2025</b> contract has the highest OI at <b>1,64,26,650</b>,
                meaning it's the most actively traded (most liquid) contract.
            </p>

            <h4 class="pb-2">Change in OI</h4>
            <p>
                This shows how much the Open Interest has increased or decreased from the previous trading session.
                For example, the <b>30-DEC-2025</b> contract increased by <b>77,775 contracts (0.48%)</b>,
                indicating fresh buying or selling activity in that contract.
            </p>

            <h4 class="pb-2">LTP (Last Traded Price)</h4>
            <p>
                This is the most recent price at which the futures contract was traded.
                It represents the current market consensus of what the Nifty will be worth at that future date.
                For the <b>30-DEC-2025</b> contract, the LTP is <b>26,148</b>.
            </p>

            <h4 class="pb-2">Change in LTP (%)</h4>
            <p>
                This shows the percentage change in price from the previous trading day.
                The <b>30-DEC-2025</b> contract increased by <b>138.5 (0.53%)</b>,
                meaning the futures price went up by about <b>0.53%</b> compared to yesterday's close.
            </p>

            <h4 class="pb-2">High &amp; Low</h4>
            <p>
                These columns show the highest and lowest prices at which the contract traded during the current
                session.
                For <b>30-DEC-2025</b>, the <b>High</b> was <b>26,424</b> and the <b>Low</b> was <b>25,857</b>,
                showing the intraday price movement range.
            </p>
            <h4 class="pb-2">Rollover Cost</h4>
            <p>
                Rollover Cost is the extra amount you pay to move your position from the current month futures
                contract to the next month futures contract.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Formula:- Next Month Futures Price − Current Month Futures Price</b><br>

            </p>
            <h4 class="pb-2"> Example</h4>
            <p>
                Imagine this situation
            </p>

            <p>
                You rent a shop for <b>December</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                December rent = <b>₹10,000</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                Now December is ending, and you want to continue the shop in <b>January</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                January rent = <b>₹10,500</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                So what extra do you pay to continue?
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>₹10,500 − ₹10,000 = ₹500</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                That extra <b>₹500</b> is the <b>ROLLOVER COST</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                You didn’t buy a new shop.<br>
                You just extended the same shop for next month, but at a higher price.
            </p>


            <h4 class="pb-2">Rollover Percentage</h4>
            <p>
                Rollover % shows how many traders decided <b>not to exit</b> their position at expiry,
                but instead <b>continued the same trade</b> in the next month contract.
            </p>

            <h4 class="pb-2"> Example</h4>
            <p>
                Suppose <b>100 traders</b> are holding December futures.
            </p>
            <p>
                When expiry comes:
                <br>• <b>70 traders</b> shift their trade to January
                <br>• <b>30 traders</b> close their positions
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Rollover % = (70 / 100) × 100 = 70%</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Meaning:</b><br>
                → Most traders continued their trade<br>
                → Indicates strong confidence in the next month’s trend
            </p>

        <h4 class="pb-2">Key Differences Between Future Chain and Option Chain</h4>

        <h4 class="pb-2">What Each Chain Shows</h4>
        <p>
            <b>Future Chain</b> displays a list of all available futures contracts for the same underlying asset
            (like Nifty) across different expiration dates. Each row shows one futures contract with the same
            characteristics—only the expiry date changes.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Option Chain</b> displays all available option contracts for the same underlying asset,
            organized by <b>strike prices</b> and <b>contract types (Call & Put)</b>.
            Each row represents a different strike price, with call and put options shown side by side.
        </p>

        <h4 class="pb-2">Core Conceptual Differences</h4>
        <table class="table table-bordered">
            <tr>
                <th>Aspect</th>
                <th>Futures</th>
                <th>Options</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Obligation</td>
                <td>You MUST buy or sell on expiry—no choice</td>
                <td>You have the RIGHT but NOT the obligation</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>What You're Choosing</td>
                <td>Only the expiration date</td>
                <td>Expiration date + strike price (entry level)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Upfront Cost</td>
                <td>No premium—only margin required</td>
                <td>Premium paid upfront</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Maximum Loss</td>
                <td>Unlimited</td>
                <td>Limited to the premium paid</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Profit Potential</td>
                <td>Unlimited</td>
                <td>Limited by premium structure</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h4 class="pb-2">Structure and Layout Differences</h4>

        <h4 class="pb-2">Future Chain Structure</h4>
        <p>
            • Simple and linear — one row per expiration date<br>
            • All contracts track the same underlying price<br>
            • Shows OI, LTP, High/Low across different dates only<br>
            • Fewer variables to analyze
        </p>

        <h4 class="pb-2">Option Chain Structure</h4>
        <p>
            • Complex table with Calls on one side and Puts on the other<br>
            • Multiple strike prices (₹26,000, ₹26,100, ₹26,200, etc.)<br>
            • Shows Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega)<br>
            • Hundreds of choices even for one expiry
        </p>

        <h4 class="pb-2">How They Work</h4>

        <h4 class="pb-2">Futures Example</h4>
        <p>
            If you buy the <b>30-DEC-2025 Nifty futures</b> at <b>26,148</b>, you are obligated to:
        </p>
        <p>
            • Take settlement at expiry, or<br>
            • Square off the position before expiry
        </p>
        <p>
            If Nifty rises to <b>27,000</b>, you profit.
            If it falls to <b>25,000</b>, you lose the same amount.
            Your profit or loss is <b>unlimited</b>.
        </p>

        <h4 class="pb-2">Options Example</h4>
        <p>
            If you buy a <b>26,200 Call option</b> expiring on <b>30-DEC-2025</b> by paying a
            <b>₹50 premium</b>, you get the right to buy Nifty at 26,200.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can:
            <br>• Exercise it if profitable
            <br>• Let it expire if not
        </p>
        <p>
            Your maximum loss is limited to the <b>₹50 premium</b>.
        </p>

        <h4 class="pb-2">Key Advantages</h4>

        <h4 class="pb-2">Future Chain Advantages</h4>
        <p>
            • High liquidity<br>
            • Lower transaction costs<br>
            • No premium — direct price exposure<br>
            • Simple to understand<br>
            • Best for strong directional trades
        </p>

        <h4 class="pb-2">Option Chain Advantages</h4>
        <p>
            • Limited risk<br>
            • Flexibility in strike and expiry selection<br>
            • Can profit from time decay<br>
            • Useful for hedging and advanced strategies<br>
            • Better in uncertain markets
        </p>

        <h4 class="pb-2">Decision Guide</h4>
        <p>
            Choose the <b>Future Chain</b> if you are confident about market direction
            and want direct exposure with high liquidity.
        </p>

        <p>
            Choose the <b>Option Chain</b> if you want limited risk, flexibility in strategy,
